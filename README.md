# Common core - 42 School Cursus 

This repository contains all the projects that I have completed as a student of the "cursus" at 42 Málaga so far. The projects are organized by order of difficulty, with the titles and grades listed in the following table:

| Project Title |	Grade
| ------------- | ---- |
| LIBFT	        | 100% | 
| FT_PRINTF     | 100% | 
| GET NEXT LINE	| 125% | 
| MINITALK	    | 100% | 

The projects in this repository cover a range of topics in computer science and software engineering, from basic programming concepts to more advanced algorithms and data structures. Each project is designed to challenge students to apply their knowledge and skills in practical, real-world scenarios.

In particular, the projects listed above demonstrate proficiency in foundational programming skills such as memory management, string manipulation, and input/output handling. The projects also showcase the ability to implement complex algorithms and data structures, as well as to work with system-level programming concepts such as signals and inter-process communication.

Overall, this repository serves as a testament to the skills and knowledge that I have acquired through my studies at 42 Málaga, and demonstrates my commitment to lifelong learning and professional development in the field of software engineering.
